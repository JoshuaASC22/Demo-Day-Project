        <h1>Pollution Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Volcanic ash from the eruption of the Indonesian volcano of Krakatoa caused the sky to darken around the world.</li>
            <li>Due to a pesticide plant accident in Bhopal India, 8,000 people died within days and many more were permanently injured.</li>
            <li>Mount Vesuvius, a volcano located in Italy, erupted in the year of 1979 and killed hundreds of civilians living in nearby towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</li>
            <li>Most air pollution isn't naturally made, but instead comes from fossil-fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas causing for a colorless and odorless gas called carbon monoxide to be produced.</li>
            <li>Factories and cars mainly produce common pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons.</li>
            <li>Burning fossil fuels and destroying forests cause a great increase in the amount of fossil fuels in the atmosphere, causing average temperatures around the globe to rise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Polluted water can either look dirthy with mud, have a nasty smell, and gabage in it or look clean but is filled with ahrmful chemicals that aren't detectable to our 5 senses.</li>
            <li>Drinking and swining in polluted water is dangerous as it can expose someone to hazardous chemicals that could cause sickness or disease.</li>
            <li>The United Nations gives and estimation of 4,000 children dying everyday due to drinking polluted water.</li>
            <li>Polluted water can harm people indirectly through the things that they consume, like fish.</li>
            <li>Oil and natural gasses are natural causes of polluted water as they leak into oceans and lakes from naturally occuring sources called petroleum seeps.</li>
            <li>Fertilizer is a major source of water pollution containing nitrogen and phosphorus</li>
            <li>Chemicals and oils from factories are dumped or seep into the ocean and are called runoff</li>
            <li>Runoff can cause toxic aquatic environments to form on the ocean and make a great environment for cyanobacteria or blue-green algae</li>
            <li>Drilling, mining, oil spills, acid mine drainage, and burried chemical waste are all contributes to pollution in the water</li>
        </ul>
         <h2>Land Pollution</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Many of the pollutants of the ocean are the same as the pollutants on the land.</li>
            <li>Plants, animals and people as well can be harmed by pesticides and fertilizers that are blown in the wind.</li>
            <li>Pesticides can enter the body through consumption.</li>
            <li>Trash that can is thrown on the ground can increase the difficulty of plants and produces of the food web to create nutrients</li>
            <li>Inefficient garbage collection can cause for an increase in land pollution.</li>
            <li>A large landfill close to Quezon City, Philippines was where a great land pollution tragedy took place in 2000 which killed 218 people.</li>
            <li>Some landfills aren't seal off completely causing some pollutants to contaminate plants and also contaminate the animals that eat it.</li>
            <li>Kamilo Beach in Hawaii is completely littered in plastic bags and bottles that are brought in through the tide.</li>
            <li>Some cities brun their garbage which does get rid of it but releases harmful heavy metals and chemicals into the air.</li>
         </ul>
